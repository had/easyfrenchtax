# easyfrenchtax
This project helps me understanding and projecting French taxes, especially wrt. stock, stock options, RSUs and other systems. It doesn't replace a tax advisor, I am not a lawyer, you should not rely blindly on this software for filling your tax return.

# What is supported
- Progressive income tax
- Family quotient (incl. capping, but excl. shared custody situations)
- Some deductions/reductions (PER, child care, home services, charity donations)
- Capping of fiscal advantages ("plafonnement des niches fiscales" in French)
- Exercising stock options, RSU acquisition gain, capital gain (but not capital loss - yet)
- Social taxes

These elements of taxation have been tested against the tax simulator of the French government. I invite you to read and understand these tests, this will give you a feeling of whether you want to trust this project or not.
